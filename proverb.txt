The grass is greener on the other side of the fence
Match made in heaven
Even Homer sometimes nods
Walls have ears
The pot calls the kettle black
To see is to believe
A little knowledge is dangerous
Like father, like son
Talk of the devil and you'll hear the flutter of his wings
To teach a fish how to swim
Pie in the sky
Every dog has his day
Even a worm will turn
Every Jack has his Gill
A sound mind in a sound body
Slow and steady win the game
Time and tide wait for no man
Shrouds have no pockets
No pains, no gains
Fine clothes make the man
Birds of a feather flock together
Where there is a will, there is a way
A bad workman finds fault with his tools
A man is known by the company he keeps
The sparrow near a school sings the primer
A loaf of bread is better than the song of many birds
One man sows and another man reaps
Love me, love my dog
Starts off with a bang and ends with a whimper
Stabbed in the back
Sweet talk
As one sows, so shall he reap
A buddy from my old stomping grounds
Adding insult to injury
A stitch in time saves nine
Mend the barn after the horse is stolen
Go home and kick the dog
Turning green with envy
Rome was not built in a day
Face the music
Well begun is half done
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
Let's get to the point
Talking to the wall
Look before you leap
Casting pearls before swine
A rags to riches story
Thorn in the side
It's no use crying over spilt milk
It takes two to tango
Kill two birds with one stone
Everyone has a skeleton in the closet
A rat in a trap
Can't get blood from a turnip
You don't know what you've got until you've lost it
Every minute seems like a thousand
Finders keepers, loser weepers
Ignorance is bliss
Icing on the cake
What's learned in the cradle is carried to the grave
You've cried wolf too many times
You could sell him the Brooklyn Bridge
He that will steal a pin will steal an ox
If you laugh, blessings will come your way
Thrown away like an old shoe
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Let sleeping dogs lie
One rotten apple spoils the barrel
Cut off your nose to spite your face
Searching for a needle in a haystack
There is no rest for a family(mother) with many children
No pains, no gains
None but the brave deserves the fair
One swallow does not make a summer
Many drops make a shower
Strike while the iron is hot
There is no place like home
No news is good news
Practice makes perfect
Easier said than done
Out of sight, out of mind
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A picture is worth a thousand words
Better late than never
It never rains but it pours
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today
Who holds the purse rules the house
It is not good to listen to flattery
Troubles never come singly
No smoke without fire
Look before you leap
Icing on the cake
Don't count the chickens before they are hatched
The early bird catches the worm
Haste makes waste
More haste less speed
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
Money makes the mare to go
A leopard can't change his spots
